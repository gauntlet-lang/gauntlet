## üöÄ Getting Started


1. **Install the .NET SDK:** If you don't have it already, head over to the official [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and grab the latest SDK. Gauntlet is built with F# on .NET, so this is essential.
2. **Clone the R:pository:** Use the `git clone` command 
3. **Build It!** Once you're in the project directory, run `dotnet build`. This will compile the F# source and ensure everything's in working order.

## üéØ Workflow

You should follow the standard GitHub flow:

1. **Fork `Gauntlet`:** Start by forking the main Gauntlet repository to your personal GitHub account.
2. **Create a Feature Branch:** Always work on a new branch. Choose a name that clearly describes your work, like `fix/type-checking`.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-feature-branch-name
    ```
3. **Code & Commit:** Write your F# code, make your changes, and commit them. Aim for small, focused commits that are easy to review. A good commit message helps a lot!
4. **Push & Pull Request:** When your changes are ready, push your branch to your fork and then open a **Pull Request (PR)** back to the main `Gauntlet` repository. In your PR description, tell us what problem you're solving or what feature you're adding.

## ‚ú® Contributing in F# 

Only contributions in F# will be allowed. 

Try to keep F# as idiomatic as possible:

* **Use Conventions:** Check out the [F# convention guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/style-guide/conventions) to learn more
* **Formatting is Key:** Before committing, always use Fantomas to format your code.
* **Keep it Focused:** Try to make each pull request address a single feature or bug. This makes reviews much easier and quicker.
